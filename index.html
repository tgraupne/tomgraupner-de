  <p class="mission">
    Cloud environments and backend architectures were always my favourite topics.
    However, during the past 5 years I became more interested and invested in technologies
    surrounding DevOps, like software lifecycle management, continuous integration and
    deployment as well as developer productivity.
  </p>

  <p class="mission">
    In 2022, I founded <a href="https://unit214.de">Unit 214 GmbH</a> together
    with Philipp Piwowarsky and Keno Dreßel.</br>
  </p>

  <p class="mission">
    With our experience as well as our transparent and flexible work,
    we always meet our clients' needs by providing<br/>
    <b>Full-Stack Development, Software Architecture and IT Consulting</b>.
  </p>

  <h2>Areas of Expertise</h2>

  <p>
    <h3>DevOps</h3>
    What has started as the blend between traditional development and operations
    teams became the new strategic standard for the management of teams and products
    in technology companies. The overall goal is to accelerate everything and the steps
    towards that goal are the “measurements of software delivery performance” and the
    implementation of a “continuous delivery pipeline”.</br>

    I will help your teams to find the right tools for the acceleration of your
    organisation and adapt them to your workflows.
  </p>

  <p>
    <h3>Kubernetes</h3>
  A lot of expert groups call Kubernetes the “operating system for cloud native infrastructures”
  and its rapid growth over the last couple of years made its importance evident.</br>

  This technology can enable your development teams to move faster because the underlying
  infrastructure of your products becomes a commodity.</br>

  Together, we will find out how Kubernetes can help your organisation to grow and your
  development teams to deliver more.
  </p>

  <p>
    <h3>Developer Productivity</h3>
    Teams in tech organisations have the tendency to always look for solutions in tools and technology.</br>

    However, sometimes, problems can’t be fixed by a new project management software or the newest version
    of some hyped framework. Especially when it comes to team dynamics, empathy and mindfulness are my
    cornerstones of a holistic perspective on developer productivity.</br>

    I will shadow your teams in their daily business to identify obstacles as well as conduct interviews to
    understand what motivates them and what may keep them from being most productive. And together, we will
    iron out everything in their way.
